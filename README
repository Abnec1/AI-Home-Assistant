# 🎙️ Python Voice Assistant (GPT-4.1 + Wake Word + Offline STT)

This project is a simple offline-first Python voice assistant that listens for a wake word ("hey assistant"), records your question using a microphone, sends it to GPT-4.1 via a GitHub-provided token, and then speaks the AI’s response aloud.

No PyAudio required – works fully offline for speech-to-text using Vosk.
